# Contract-Payment
This mini project is one of my free time projects, that was developed to solve a series of exercises, as a way to practice JAVA

## The exercice:

A company wants to automate the processing of its contracts. Processing a contract consists of generating the installments to be paid for that contract, based on the
desired number of months.
The company uses an online payment service to pay the installments. Online payment services typically charge a monthly interest, as well as a fee for payment. For now, the service hired by the company is Paypal, which applies simple interest of 1% for each installment, plus a payment rate of 2%.
Make a program to read the data of a contract (contract number, contract date, and total contract value). Then, the program should read the number of months for installment of the contract, and from there generate the records of installments to be paid (date and amount), the first installment being paid one month after the contract date, the second installment two months after the contract and so on. Show plot data on the screen.
